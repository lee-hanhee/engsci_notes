\subsection{Induction (Ap. A.2)}
    \textbf{Motivation:} 45\% induction, 45\% contradiction, 10\% math
    \begin{process}
        Given predicate $P(n)$: $[P(1) \land \; \forall n \; P(n) \rightarrow P(n+1)] \rightarrow \forall n P(n)$
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Basis Step:} Prove $P(c)$ for some value $c$. 
            \item \textbf{Hypothesis:} Assume true for $P(n)$.
            \item \textbf{Inductive step:} Use the hypothesis to show its true for $P(n) \implies P(n+1)$.
        \end{enumerate}
        Therefore, $\forall \; n \; P(n)$.
    \end{process}

    \begin{intuition}
        Think about how this builds an argument incrementally from the base cases up to $P(n+1)$. Induction proves $P(n)$ by first proving $P(i)$, for every $i$ from $c$ to $n$.
    \end{intuition}

    \begin{intuition}
        You don't always need to guess the exact value of a summation in order to use induction. Instead, use induction to prove an upper or lower bound on a summation.
    \end{intuition}

    \begin{example}
        Prove $\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = 1 + 2 + \ldots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Basis:} $n=1 \text{, } \frac{1(1+1)}{2} = 1$
            \item \textbf{Inductive hypothesis:} Assume true for n, $1 + 2 + \ldots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$
            \item \textbf{Inductive step:} Prove for $n+1$: $1 + 2 + \ldots + n + (n+1) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + (n+1) = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$
        \end{enumerate}
        Therefore, we proved by induction that the formula, $\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \text{ for } n+1$ is true for $n+1$.
    \end{example}

    \begin{example}
        Prove the asymptotic upper bound $\sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = O\left(3^n\right)$ or $\sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k \leq c3^n$ for some constant $c$.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Basis:} $n = 0 \text{: } \sum_{k=0}^{0} 3^k = 1 \leq c \text{ as long as } c \geq 1$
            \item \textbf{Inductive hypothesis:} Assume that the bound holds for $n$.
            \item \textbf{Inductive step:} Prove for $n+1$: 
            \begin{align*}
                \sum_{k=0}^{n+1} 3^k &= \sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k + 3^{n+1} \\
                                    &\leq c3^n + 3^{n+1} \text{ by the inductive hypothesis} \\ 
                                    &= \left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{c}\right) c3^{n+1} \text{ by factoring out } c3^{n+1}\\
                                    &\leq c3^{n+1} \text{ since we are using the inequality it still holds true}
            \end{align*}
        \end{enumerate} 
        Therefore, as long as $\left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{c}\right) \leq 1 \text{ or } c \geq \frac{3}{2}. \text{ Thus, } \sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = O(3^n)$.
    \end{example}

    \begin{example}
        Prove that for all integers \( n \geq 1 \), the following inequality holds: $n < 2^n$

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Basis:} 
            We check the case where \( n = 1 \):
            \[
            1 < 2^1 = 2.
            \]
            Since this is true, the base case holds.

            \item \textbf{Inductive Hypothesis:} 
            Assume that the inequality holds for some integer \( n \geq 1 \), i.e.,
            \[
            n < 2^n.
            \]
            
            \item \textbf{Inductive Step:} 
            We need to prove that the inequality holds for \( n = n+1 \), i.e.,
            \[
            n+1 < 2^{n+1}.
            \]
            Starting with the left-hand side:
            \[
            n+1 < \boxed{2^n} + 1 < 2^n + 2^n = 2 \cdot 2^n = 2^{n+1}.
            \]
            Therefore, the inequality holds for \( n = n+1 \).
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Note:} The boxed in part is applying the hypothesis.
            \end{itemize}

        \end{enumerate}

        \textbf{Conclusion:} By the principle of mathematical induction, the inequality \( n < 2^n \) holds for all \( n \geq 1 \).
    \end{example}

    \begin{example}
        Prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd positive integers is \( n^2 \), i.e.,
        \[
        1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2n-1) = n^2.
        \]

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Basis:} 
            For \( n = 1 \), the sum of the first odd positive integer is just \( 1 \):
            \[
            1 = 1^2.
            \]
            Therefore, the formula holds for \( n = 1 \).
            
            \item \textbf{Inductive Hypothesis:} 
            Assume that the formula holds for some integer \( n \), i.e.,
            \[
            1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2n-1) = n^2.
            \]
            
            \item \textbf{Inductive Step:} 
            We need to prove that the formula holds for \( n+1 \), i.e., 
            \[
            \boxed{1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2n-1)} + (2n+1) = (n+1)^2.
            \]
            Using the inductive hypothesis, we know:
            \[
            1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2n-1) = n^2.
            \]
            Now, adding the next odd integer \( 2n + 1 \) to both sides, we get:
            \[
            n^2 + (2n + 1) = (n+1)^2.
            \]
            Therefore, both sides are equal, proving that the formula holds for \( n+1 \).

        \end{enumerate}

        \textbf{Conclusion:} By the principle of mathematical induction, the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) odd positive integers, \( 1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2n-1) = n^2 \), holds for all \( n \geq 1 \).
    \end{example}

    \begin{example}
        Prove that the power set of a set \( S \), where \( |S| = n \), has \( 2^n \) elements.

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Basis:} 
            For \( n = 0 \), let \( S = \emptyset \) (the empty set). The power set of \( S \) is:
            \[
            2^S = \{\emptyset\}.
            \]
            This power set contains exactly 1 element, which matches \( 2^0 = 1 \). 
            
            Now consider \( n = 1 \), where \( S = \{A\} \). The power set of \( S \) is:
            \[
            2^S = \{\emptyset, \{A\}\}.
            \]
            This power set contains 2 elements, which matches \( 2^1 = 2 \). Thus, the base case holds for \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \).

            \item \textbf{Inductive Hypothesis:} 
            Assume that for a set \( S \) with \( |S| = n \), the power set of \( S \) has \( 2^n \) elements. 
            
            \item \textbf{Inductive Step:} 
            We need to prove that if \( |S| = n+1 \), then the power set of \( S \), \( 2^S \), contains \( 2^{n+1} \) elements.
            \vspace{1em}

            Let \( S \) be a set with \( n+1 \) elements, and let \( a \) be an additional element such that \( S = S' \cup \{a\} \), where \( S' \) is a set of \( n \) elements. 
            
            \vspace{1em}
            The power set of \( S \) consists of:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Subsets of \( S' \) that do not include \( a \). By the inductive hypothesis, there are \( 2^n \) such subsets.
                \item Subsets of \( S' \) that include \( a \). There are \( 2^n \) such subsets as well, since each subset of \( S' \) can either include or exclude \( a \).
            \end{itemize}
            
            Therefore, the total number of subsets in \( 2^S \) is:
            \[
            2^n + 2^n = 2 \cdot 2^n = 2^{n+1}.
            \]
            This proves that the power set of a set with \( n+1 \) elements contains \( 2^{n+1} \) elements.
            
        \end{enumerate}

        \textbf{Conclusion:} By the principle of mathematical induction, the power set of a set \( S \) with \( |S| = n \) contains \( 2^n \) elements for all \( n \geq 0 \).
    \end{example}

    \begin{example}
        Show that any \( 2^n \times 2^n \) chessboard with one square missing can be tiled using L-shaped tiles.

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Basis:} 
            For \( n = 1 \), the chessboard is a \( 2 \times 2 \) grid. With one square removed, it is clear that the remaining three squares can be covered by a single L-shaped tile, as shown in the diagram below:
            \[
            \begin{matrix}
            \square & \square \\
            \square & \text{x} 
            \end{matrix}
            \]
            This satisfies the base case for \( n = 1 \).

            \item \textbf{Inductive Hypothesis:} 
            Assume that for a \( 2^n \times 2^n \) chessboard with any single square removed, the board can be tiled using L-shaped tiles. That is, the tiling is possible for a board of size \( 2^n \times 2^n \) where one square is missing.

            \item \textbf{Inductive Step:} 
            We need to prove that a \( 2^{n+1} \times 2^{n+1} \) chessboard with one square removed can also be tiled with L-shaped tiles.

            Divide the \( 2^{n+1} \times 2^{n+1} \) chessboard into four \( 2^n \times 2^n \) quadrants. One of these quadrants will have the missing square. To apply the inductive hypothesis, place an L-shaped tile at the center of the chessboard to cover one square from each of the other three quadrants, as shown below:
            
            \[
            \begin{matrix}
            \square & \square & \square & \square \\
            \square & \text{x} & \text{L} & \square \\
            \square & \text{L} & \text{L} & \square \\
            \square & \square & \square & \square 
            \end{matrix}
            \]
            
            Now, each of the four \( 2^n \times 2^n \) quadrants either has one square removed (the original missing square or the square covered by the L-shaped tile in the other three quadrants). By the inductive hypothesis, each \( 2^n \times 2^n \) quadrant can be tiled using L-shaped tiles. Hence, the entire \( 2^{n+1} \times 2^{n+1} \) board can be tiled.

        \end{enumerate}

        \textbf{Conclusion:} By the principle of mathematical induction, any \( 2^n \times 2^n \) chessboard with one square removed can be tiled with L-shaped tiles for all \( n \geq 1 \).
    \end{example}

    \begin{warning}
        Consider the following fallacious proof that \( \sum_{k=1}^n k = O(n) \). 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Basis:} \( \sum_{k=1}^1 k = O(1) \) 
            \item \textbf{Inductive hypothesis:} Assume that the bound holds for \( n \).
            \item \textbf{Inductive step:} Prove for $n+1$:
            \begin{align*}
                \sum_{k=1}^{n+1} k &= \sum_{k=1}^{n} k + (n + 1) \\
                                    &= O(n) + (n + 1) \\
                                    &= O(n + 1) \quad \text{(wrong!)}
            \end{align*}
        \end{enumerate}

        The bug in the argument is that the “constant” hidden by the “big-O” grows with \( n \) and thus is not constant. We have not shown that the same constant works for all \( n \).
    \end{warning}

\subsection{Contradiction}
    \begin{process}
        Predicate $P(n)$ either true or false.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If want to prove true, assume $\neg P(n)$.
            \item Work towards a contradiction by working with the expression $\neg P(n)$ to get to a contradiction.
            \item If this resulted in a contradiction then $P(n)$ is true. 
        \end{enumerate}
        
    \end{process}

    \begin{example}
        Prove that if $x^2 - 5x + 4 < 0, \text{ then } x >0$
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{ATaC:} Assume towards a contradiction (ATaC) that \( x^2 - 5x + 4 < 0 \) but \( x \leq 0 \).
            \vspace{1em}
            \item Analyze the quadratic expression:
            \[
            x^2 - 5x + 4 = (x - 1)(x - 4)
            \]
            Thus, the inequality becomes:
            \[
            (x - 1)(x - 4) < 0
            \]
            
            \item This inequality implies that \( x \) must lie between the roots 1 and 4, i.e., \( 1 < x < 4 \).
            \vspace{1em}
            \item \textbf{Contradiction:} However, the assumption \( x \leq 0 \) contradicts this because there are no values of \( x \leq 0 \) that satisfy \( 1 < x < 4 \).
            \end{enumerate}
            \vspace{1em}
            Therefore, the contradiction shows that the assumption \( x \leq 0 \) cannot be true if \( x^2 - 5x + 4 < 0 \). Hence, if \( x^2 - 5x + 4 < 0 \), it must be that \( x > 0 \).
    \end{example}

    \begin{example}
        Prove $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{ATaC:} Suppose \(\sqrt{2}\) is rational. Then we can write:
            
            \[
            \sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}
            \]
            
            where \( a \) and \( b \) are integers with no common divisors other than 1 (i.e., the fraction is in its simplest form).
            \vspace{1em}
            \item \textbf{Square Both Sides:}
            
            \[
            2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}
            \Rightarrow a^2 = 2b^2
            \]
            
            This implies that \( a^2 \) is even (since it is twice an integer). Therefore, \( a \) must also be even (by a lemma which states that if \( a^2 \) is even, then \( a \) is even).
            \vspace{1em}

            \item \textbf{Express \( a \) as an Even Number:}
            
            \[
            a = 2k \text{ for some integer } k
            \]
            
            Substitute \( a = 2k \) into the equation:
            
            \[
            (2k)^2 = 2b^2 \Rightarrow 4k^2 = 2b^2 \Rightarrow 2k^2 = b^2
            \]
            
            This implies that \( b^2 \) is even, and thus \( b \) must also be even.
            \vspace{1em}
            \item \textbf{Contradiction:} Since both \( a \) and \( b \) are even, they have a common factor of 2. This contradicts our initial assumption that \( \frac{a}{b} \) is in its simplest form.
            \vspace{1em}
        
        \end{enumerate}
        The contradiction shows that our assumption that \(\sqrt{2}\) is rational is false. Therefore, \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.
    \end{example}

    \begin{example}
            Show that if \( a^2 \) is even, then \( a \) is even.

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Assume the opposite:} 
            Suppose \( a^2 \) is even, but \( a \) is odd.
            
            \item \textbf{Write the form of an odd number:} 
            If \( a \) is odd, then we can express \( a \) as:
            \[
            a = 2k + 1 \quad \text{for some integer } k.
            \]
            
            \item \textbf{Square both sides:} 
            Now, compute \( a^2 \):
            \[
            a^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1.
            \]
            
            \item \textbf{Analyze the result:} 
            From the equation, we can see that \( a^2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1 \), which is an odd number (because it is of the form \( 2m + 1 \), where \( m \) is an integer).

            \item \textbf{Contradiction:} 
            This contradicts the assumption that \( a^2 \) is even, as we have just shown that \( a^2 \) must be odd if \( a \) is odd.

        \end{enumerate}

        Since assuming \( a \) is odd leads to a contradiction, it must be the case that \( a \) is even. 

        \textbf{Conclusion:} If \( a^2 \) is even, then \( a \) must be even.
    \end{example}
